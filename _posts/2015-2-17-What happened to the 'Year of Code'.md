title: What happened to the 'Year of Code'?

###Seriously, what happened?

Remember back when the government [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/year-of-code-and-500000-fund-to-inspire-future-tech-experts-launched) the ambitious project called [Year of Code](http://yearofcode.org/)? And the dreadful interview which followed shortly after?

Well, looks like it hasn't done much as a new [House of Lords Digital Skills Committee report](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240240505/UK-failing-to-address-digital-skills-shortage-says-Lords-report) suggests that the UK is failing to address the digital skills shortage.

One area of the report, titled [Make or Break: The UK's Digital Future](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldselect/lddigital/111/111.pdf), looks at education and the report mentions that:

*'Only 44.9% of secondary school ICT teachers have a post A level qualification relevant to ICT, and the overwhelming majority of primary school teachers do not have a computing background.'*

**Box 10: Key Statistic: Teachers, Page 47**

Which is a terrifying number as we are now fully committed to the new curriculum, which launched last year.

Although we are seeing the launch of the BBC Micro Bit this October, I'm not sure how effective this will be if Teachers in the first place aren't confident in their own skills.

After doing some searches into the Year of Code, I haven't found much evidence which shows what this project has actually achieved - most of the links Google showed me were posts discussing the disastrous interview on Newsnight. Furthermore, the official Twitter account was last updated in April 2014 - only 2 months after the project launched. What I also noticed was that the official Facebook page for the Year of Code no longer exists.

It's a shame we may never know what exactly happened, but considering this cost the UK tax payer Â£500,000 - I'd like to know what went on behind closed doors.
