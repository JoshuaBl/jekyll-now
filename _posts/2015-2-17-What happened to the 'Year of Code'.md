title: What happened to the 'Year of Code'?
---

###Seriously, what happened?

Remember back when the government [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/year-of-code-and-500000-fund-to-inspire-future-tech-experts-launched) the ambitious project callled [Year of Code](http://yearofcode.org/)? And the dreadful interview which followed shortly after?

Well, looks like it hasn't done much as a new [House of Lords Digital Skills Committee report](http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240240505/UK-failing-to-address-digital-skills-shortage-says-Lords-report) suggests that the UK is failing to address the digital skills shortage.

One area of the report, titled [Make or Break: The UK's Digital Future](http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201415/ldselect/lddigital/111/111.pdf), looks at education and the report mentions that:

*'Only 44.9% of secondary school ICT teachers have a post A level qualification relevant to ICT, and the overwhelming majority of primary school teachers do not have a computing background.'*

**Box 10: Key Statistic: Teachers, Page 47**

Which is a terrifying number as we are now fully committed to the new curriculum, which launched last year.
