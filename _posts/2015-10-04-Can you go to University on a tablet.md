###2015 Edition - better late than never!

With students going to University for the first time or returning this year - here is a better late than never look at tablets currently on the market right now and to answer one question:

#Can you go to University on a tablet?

The technology in tablets has made some amazing progress over the years; 64 Bit system architecture, greater than full HD displays, wide variety of applications and better battery life have all made tablets very popular for digesting content from the Internet. But can these devices be used by students attending University? In this post, this will look at the possibility of using either a iOS, Android or a Windows tablet at University (under the assumption that a laptop wouldn't be used).

We'll talk about Android first.

###Android
I'm a big Android user. I have an Android phone and tablet (Nexus 5 and 9) and while Android thrives on phones, on tablets however - it's a different story.

Although there are many different tablets which run Android (and provide a wide variety of different sizes and prices), there are two factors which ruin the overall Android experience on Android:

<li>Number of tablet designed applications</li>
<li>Accessories</li>

The number and quality of Android applications designed for tablets is still a major problem. The situation is improving, but it isn't as good as the selection on Apple's iPad range. You can run the same Android application on your tablet which you use on your phone - but the UI will appear stretched across the screen which can make navigating around the application a bit of a challenge on a larger screen.

The number and quality of accessories available is also another problem. For most tablets, there aren't any accessories but for the popular tablets - the accessories come at a premium and often are a small collection. If there are any third party accessories available, I've found the quality to be a bit low (but these aren't made by companies such as Logitech).

I wouldn't recommend an Android tablet for University as although there is Microsoft Office for Android, there isn't any applications for subjects such as Computer Science or Physics (especially when there is software which is needed for the course you are studying) so getting any serious work done is a challenge.

###iOS (iPad)
I've owned an iPad Air (before I gave it to my parents) and one of the best parts of using an iOS devices is the application support for the iOS ecosystem. Like modern Android tablets, the screen resolutions are greater than 1080p and all feature 64 Bit system architecture. However, these features come at a premium. iPad's aren't cheap, even the mini range can be a bit pricey compared to other tablets, the same goes with the Apple made accessories. Fortunately, there are plenty of third parties who make accessories which you can find locally and can be of high quality.

Despite this, I still wouldn't recommend an iPad to go to University - it still suffers the same problem as Android tablets; there isn't any applications for subjects such as Computer Science or Physics (or anything that the University requires you to use)

###Windows
With the Surface range by Microsoft, it appears that the concept of a Windows tablet is taking off. Both the Pro and non Pro both use Intel processors and run full versions of Windows, not Windows RT. This allows users to install programs such as Steam and Adobe creative studio, instead of waiting for a mobile version. The only problem with the top end Windows tablets is the cost. The Surface Pro 4 starts at £749, which for a "tablet" is definitely on the top end of many budgets for students. However, the Surface 3 starts £419 but does come with a smaller drive and 2 GB of RAM.

There are plenty of official accessories available (such as docks and cases), but these can be very expensive (but could be worth it depending on how someone uses the Surface).

Out of the three, you can go to University on a Windows tablet.

But would I recommend a tablet for University? No, a laptop would provide more power, better battery life and a physical keyboard to type on. In my experience - tablets are great as a 'bridge' between the tablet and the PC, but struggle on their own to get any work done on them.

Perhaps this will change in the next few years.
